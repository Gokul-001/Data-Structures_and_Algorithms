## Cab-Booking System ðŸš• (Console Application) :</h3>
    + There are n number of taxiâ€™s. For simplicity, assume 4.

    + But it should work for any number of taxiâ€™s.

    + The are 6 points(A,B,C,D,E,F)
    
    + All the points are in a straight line, and each point is     15kms away from the adjacent points.

    + Each taxi charges Rs.100 minimum for the first 5 kilometers and Rs.10 for the subsequent kms

    + All taxiâ€™s are initially stationed at A.
    
    + When a customer books a Taxi, a free taxi at that point is allocated
    
    + If no free taxi is available at that point, a free taxi at the nearest point is allocated.
    
    + If two taxiâ€™s are free at the same point, one with lower earning is allocated
    
    + Note that the taxi only charges the customer from the pickup point to the drop point. Not the distance it travels from an adjacent point to pickup the customer.
    
    + If no taxi is free at that time, booking is rejected
